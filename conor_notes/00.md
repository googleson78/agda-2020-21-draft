# syntactic differences from haskell
* : - actually originally from type theory
* spaces

# highlighting
not syntactic, based on semantics (what the "type" of something is)

# lec
datatypes
made with constructors

types usually start with uppercase letters
values usually start with lowercase letters

Set - "the type of boring types"
Set is like the * kind in Haskell

records are "different"
you specify what all the fields are (like in C/C++/java/etc)
to construct, give a value for all the fields

type parameters
`_+_`
constructors made by giving their types

identifiers - a string of non-`(){}\->;:` characters
unicode too!
spacing is very important and mandatory! to distinguish between identifiers

underscores for mixfix - they're normal names, but you can also use them as mixfix
  don't overdo it!

types as propositions - `_+_`, `_*_`
  how do we "prove" vs how do we make types
    * `_+_`
    * `_*_`
    * `One`
    * `Zero`
    * `->`


so in general - how do we construct types vs how do we do proofs

function syntax `(x : T) -> S` where `S` is type *dependent on* `x` (example `*-comm`)
we can just write them in one parens if we have a lot - `(x y z : T) -> S`
implicit brackets - `{}` - implicit and infer
we can use `()` to take them as arguments instead
in haskell we can omit them, and it just works
but we don't do that here, because type inference can't handle it

interaction explanation while doing it
`what's the goal?` C-c C-,
dots/`Not in scope` in the interaction window are for "this parameter exists, but is hidden"
remember to always ask what's going on first!

for records, we can unpack, or use selectors
`case split` C-c C-c (with filled in hole, or specifying it after)

`introduce constructor` C-c C-r

show type error

`try to fit term in hole` C-c C-spc
`try to auto` C-c C-a - doesn't work when things get complicated

all of this is "what should the computer do" - the "assistant" part of "proof assistant"

propositions as types - functions are taking apart arguments, or looking at cases in logic, to construct your proof

`naughtE` - when agda can infer that you cannot possibly use any constructor, agda/you can mark it with () on the LHS of a definition
  "this can't be happening to me"
  whenever you don't want something to be happening, you should make sure you have a `Zero` handy

maybe do a "agda install party"?
